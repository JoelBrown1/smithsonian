		<EpisodeSummary>In November 19, 1946, a U.S. military transport plane goes out of control while flying over the Swiss Alps and crashes high in the mountains. Miraculously, all 12 passengers and crew survive the accident, but their safety is anything but assured. The aircraft has flown miles off course, and its position is unknown. Food supplies are low, the temperature is dropping, and their radio battery is running out of juice. Time is quickly running out. The fate of the survivors will depend on one man, one plane, and one inspired idea.</EpisodeSummary>
