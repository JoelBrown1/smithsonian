		<EpisodeSummary>Since the eighth century, the Samurai have held a special place in Japanese history and culture.

Using rare 16th century war documents, we tell the story of a Samurai coming of age during that time. Witness his rise from peasant boy to foot soldier to ruthless warrior, all brought to life through stunning re-enactments and expert testimony from Japanese and martial arts historians.</EpisodeSummary>
