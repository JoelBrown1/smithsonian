		<Episode>Amy Winehouse: One Shining Night</Episode>
		<EpisodeSummary>The BBC called her &quot;the pre-eminent vocal talent of her generation.&quot; But on a stormy December night in 2006, before the world saw her as a superstar, she was simply Amy Winehouse, playing an acoustic set in a tiny church for an Irish TV music series. Witness that evening's searing performance, featuring songs from the album, Back To Black, including &quot;Rehab&quot; and &quot;You Know I'm No Good.&quot; Then hear, in her own words, how the influences of Mahalia Jackson, Thelonious Monk, and even Salt-N-Pepa helped her forge her own jazz pop style.</EpisodeSummary>
