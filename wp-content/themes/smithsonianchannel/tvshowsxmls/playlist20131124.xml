		<EpisodeSummary>Since the eighth century, the Samurai have held a special place in Japanese history and culture. But over the years, legend has obscured the truth about how these elite knights actually lived, loved, fought, and died. Using rare 16th century war documents, we tell the story of a Samurai coming of age during that time. Witness his rise from peasant boy to foot soldier to ruthless warrior, all brought to life through stunning re-enactments and expert testimony from Japanese and martial arts historians.</EpisodeSummary>
